# Instructions for Your Folder README  

Hey team! üòä

To keep things smooth and organized for the final report, let‚Äôs each create a README.md file in our folders. We can follow the structure below and include all the related files for our work. This will help us pull everything together easily later on.üöÄ


This structure helps make sure that:  
1. All the important **files and documentation** are included in your folder üìÇ.  
2. You document **at least one model**, but feel free to add more for comparison üìä.  
3. The instructions for reproducing your results are clear and easy to follow üìù.

## 1. **Folder Contents**  
Provide a brief explanation of the files in your folder. The files should include:  

- **Code Files**: Notebooks or scripts for your models (e.g., `model_rf.ipynb`, `svm_model.py`).  
- **Preprocessed Data (Optional)**: Include preprocessed datasets or feature-engineered files.  
- **README.md**: This file documenting your work.  

**Example:**  
- `random_forest_model.ipynb`: Code for the Random Forest model.  
- `svm_model.py`: Script for the SVM model.    
- `preprocessed_data.csv`: Dataset after preprocessing steps.  
- `README.md`: Documentation for my work.

## 2. **Overview**  
Share a quick overview of the work you‚Äôve done, including the label you‚Äôre focusing on and the goal of your models.  

**For example:**  
"This folder includes my work on the SOC label regression. I experimented with different models like Random Forest and SVM to predict SOC values using the provided dataset."

## 3. **Models Tested**  
Give a brief description of each model you tried out. For every model, please include: 

- **Model Type**: (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Neural Network).  
- **Libraries Used**: (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow).  
- **Key Hyperparameters**: List any important hyperparameters and their values.  

**Example:**  
### **Model 1: Random Forest**  
- Libraries: Scikit-learn  
- Hyperparameters:  
  - `n_estimators`: 100  
  - `max_depth`: 10  
  - `criterion`: gini  

### **Model 2: Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- Libraries: Scikit-learn  
- Hyperparameters:  
  - `kernel`: rbf  
  - `C`: 1.0

## 4. **Data and Preprocessing (Optional)**  
Give a quick overview of the dataset and any preprocessing or feature engineering steps you applied (if you did) before training the models. 

**Include the following:**  
- Train/Test Split (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).  
- Steps applied:  
  - Handling missing values.  
  - Feature scaling or normalization.  
  - Feature engineering (e.g., creating new features).  

**Example:**  
- Data Split: 80% training, 20% testing  
- Preprocessing:  
  - Filled missing values with the column mean.  
  - Scaled features to the range [0, 1].  
  - Created new feature `X1 * X2`.

## 5. **Results**  
Let‚Äôs document the performance metrics of each model you tested. Feel free to use a table to make it easier to compare the results.

**Metrics to include (where applicable):**  
- MSE, MAE, R-squared  

### **Model Comparison Table:**  

| Model                 | Data Used   | Preprocessing        | MSE      | MAE      | R-Squared |  
|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------|----------|----------|-----------|  
| Random Forest         | Original   | Normalization        | 0.015    | 0.080    | 0.91      |  
| Support Vector Machine| Processed  | Normalization + FE   | 0.020    | 0.095    | 0.89      |
